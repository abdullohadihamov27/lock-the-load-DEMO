            <p>As 2023 comes to a close, iti s time to showcase and celebrate some of the top-performing photos by outstanding 500px contributors. These are photos that stood out to content buyers throughout the year. Some were new and submitted to Licensing in 2023, while others have had repeated successful sales over the <br /> years.</p>

            <p>Popular themes throughout 2023 included technology, connection, support, culture, community, family, health, wellness, workplaces, and travel. To be a successful  commercial photographer, it is essential to stay on top of the trends and use those  concepts to your advantage when keywording and titling Licensing photos, allowing  them to surface better when searched.</p>
